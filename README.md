# libdspl-2.0 free вigital signal processing algorithm library

libdspl-2.0 — opensource cross-platform digital signal processing algorithm library, written in C language.
Distributed under LGPL v3 license. This allows to use this library in all applications with dynamic linking.

libdspl-2.0 includes follow algorithms sets:
* Digital spectral analysis, discrete and fast Fourier transform algorithms.
* Analog and digital IIR filters design and analysis.
* Digital FIR filters design and analysis.
* Windows function collection includes 15 different parametric and nonparametric window functions.
* Digital Hilbert transform algorithms.
* Mathematical sections includes trigonometric, hyperbolic, elliptic functions of real and complex variables.
* Pseudorandom numbers generation algorithms.
* Statistic functions.
* Linar algebra algorithms (BLAS and LAPACK packages are used under the hood of the DSPL-2.0 library).
* Digital resampling algorithms.


### Build and run libdspl-2.0
To build the DSPL-2.0 library on Windows, a special set of programs dsplib toolchain is provided. Dsplib toolchain includes GCC, GNUPLOT, CodeBlocks IDE, Far file manager and also Unix utilities for Windows OS.
